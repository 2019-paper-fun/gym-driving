# Driving Simulator

We are designing and implementing a clean, elegant driving simulator for deep learning experiments. The simulator provides a diagrammatic top-down view of one or more cars on a track, taking as input car controls and parameters and outputting the next position and velocity for each car so it can be linked with a policy. We will learn a policy using deep learning from demonstrations, evaluate the policy under learning variations, and finally evaluate policies with the real cars.


To use this driving simulator, you will need to install PyGame and OpenAI Gym on Python 2.

To run the sim, execute:

$ python2 run_simulator.py
